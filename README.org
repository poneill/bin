* Overview
This repository contains some mundane shell scripts.  Most of them are
unlikely to be of any use to anyone but me, but you are welcome to
them anyway.
* Setup
  Make sure the bin folder is in your path:
: export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
* Contents
- cleamacs :: remove emacs backup files from current directory
- udel :: delete all of the qsub jobs matching the argument
- qclean :: Clean up temporary files created by qsub
- assassinate :: kill processes by name
- emin :: kill emacs.  The existence of this script is kind of an
          embarrassment.
- untgz :: do the right thing to a .tgz file.
